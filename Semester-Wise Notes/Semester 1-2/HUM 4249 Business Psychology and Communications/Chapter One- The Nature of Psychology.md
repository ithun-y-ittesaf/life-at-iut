## The Scope of Psychology
Psychology can be defined as the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. As astonishing variety of topics fit this description, as can be seen in the brief examples presented next. 

### Random Ideas
*prosopagnosia* is a condition where people can recognize similar faces as a result of damage to a particular region on the right side of the brain - yet they can do just about anything else normally. 

>> Example: Neurologist Oliver Sacks (1985) in his book *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat*, Man complained to a waiter about someone staring at him but turns out it was a mirror. 
>
>This indicates that some functions of the brain (facial recognition) are localized.

*Fundamental Attribution Error* is the idea that when explaining the behaviors of others, people tend to overestimate the causal effect of personality traits and underestimate those of situational factors - something that is reversed for when they are explaining their own behavior. 

*Over justification Effect* is the phenomenon where providing external rewards for an activity that someone already finds intrinsically enjoyable can reduce the intrinsic motivation in that activity. 

*Rats and Eating (history of deprivation)*: It is seen that if rats are first deprived of food, then allowed to eat until they return to their normal weight, and finally allowed to eat as much as they want, they eat more than rats that have no history of deprivation.

*GTA VI and its effects*: Although many observers believed that violent video games would have a cathartic effect, they were wrong. 

### Nature-Nurture Debate
Early philosophers believed that this knowledge and understanding could be accessed through careful reasoning and introspection. 

*Decartes* supported the nature view by arguing that some ideas (such as God, the self, geometric axioms, perfection, and infinity) are innate. He is also notable for his conception of the body as a machine that can be studied much like any other machines.

*John Locke* believed that the human mind at birth is $Tabula$ $Rosa$, a blank slate on which experience writes knowledge and understanding as the individual matures. This perspective gave birth to **associationist psychology**.

#### The beginnings of scientific psychology
In the 19th century, Wilhelm Wundt established the first psychological laboratory at the University of Leipzig in Germany, 1879. 

Wundt relied on *introspection* to study mental processes i.e. observing and recording the nature of one's own perceptions, thoughts, and feelings. Although the concept was inherited from philosophy, Wundt added a new dimension to the concept. Pure self-observation was not sufficient, it had to be supplemented by experiments. 
He systematically varied some physical dimension of a stimulus such as intensity, and used the introspective method to determine how these physical changes modified the participant's conscious experience of the stimulus. This proved unworkable particularly for rapid mental events due to the inconsistencies in results even after extensive training.

#### Structuralism and Functionalism
*E.B. Titchener* from Cornell University (trained by Wundt) introduced the term *structuralism* - the analysis of mental structures - to describe this branch of psychology.

*Willaim James* from Harvard felt that analyzing the elements of consciousness was less important than understanding its fluid, personal nature - *functionalism*, studying how the mind works to enable an organism to adapt to and function in its environment.

*These two ideas were later replaced with three newer schools: Behaviorism, Gestalt Psychology, and Psychoanalysis*

#### Behaviorism - John B. Watson
The theory of learning based on the idea that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning and conditioning occurs through interaction with the environment.
#### Gestalt Psychology - Max Wetheimer and his colleagues: Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Kohler
The theory of learning based on the idea that perpetual experiences depend on the patterns formed by stimuli and on the organization of experience. What we actually see is related to the background against which an object appears as well as to other aspects of the overall pattern of stimulation.

*Key Interests of GP*: Perception of Motion, How People Judge Size, Appearance of Colors under Changes in Illumination.

*Influeced by*: Kurt Lewin, Solomon Asch (people see wholes rather than isolated parts from the simple case of object perception to the more complex case of person perception), and Fritz Heider

#### Psychoanalaysis
It is both a theory of personality and a method of psychotherapy originated by *Sigmund Freud* around the turn of 20th century.

At the center of Freud's theory is the concept of the *unconscious* - the thoughts, attitudes, impulses, wishes, motivations, and emotions of which we are unaware. 

During therapy, Freud used *free association*, in which the patient was instructed to say whatever comes to mind as a way of bringing unconscious wishes into awareness. 

In classical Freudian theory, the motivations behind unconscious wishes almost always involved sex or aggression. Hence, his theory was not widely accepted.

#### Later Developments in the 20th Century

- **Pre-WWII Psychology**:
    
    - Dominated by **behaviorism**, especially in the U.S.
    - **Gestalt psychology** and **psychoanalysis** made important contributions but were less influential.
        
- **Post-WWII Developments**:
    
    - Increased interest in psychology.
    - New tools and electronic instruments allowed exploration of a wider range of problems.
    - Earlier theoretical approaches were seen as too narrow.
        
- **Impact of Computers (1950s)**:
    
    - Computers performed tasks once limited to humans (e.g., chess, theorem-proving).
    - Used as models for **information-processing** in psychology.
    - **Herbert Simon** and colleagues showed computers could simulate psychological processes.
    - Information-processing models offered a dynamic alternative to behaviorism.
    - Enabled formalization of Gestalt and psychoanalytic ideas.
        
- **Analogy with Memory**:
    
    - Computer memory (RAM to hard drive) compared to human **working memory to long-term memory**.
    - Referenced **Atkinson & Shiffrin’s** memory model.
        
- **Development of Linguistics**:
    
    - **Noam Chomsky’s** work in 1957 (e.g., _Syntactic Structures_) inspired **psycholinguistics**.
    - Led to analysis of mental structures behind language.
        
- **Neuropsychology Advances**:
    
    - Linked brain regions to mental and behavioral processes.
    - **Roger Sperry** won Nobel Prize in 1981 for this work.
    - Biomedical tech furthered research on brain-mind connections.
        
- **Rise of Cognitive Psychology**:
    
    - Emphasizes scientific study of **mental processes and structures**.
    - Expanded to perception, motivation, emotion, personality, clinical and social psychology.
        
- **Conclusion**:
    
    - Psychology shifted from focusing solely on observable behavior back to studying the **mind**, but now with better tools and methodologies.


### Contemporary Psychological Perspectives

### **General Overview**

- Each **psychological perspective** offers a different way of understanding behavior.
- Example: If you punch someone after being insulted:
  
    - **Biological**: Brain activity and muscle movement.
    - **Behavioral**: Stimulus-response based on past reinforcement.
    - **Cognitive**: Thought processes, goals, and planning.
    - **Psychoanalytic**: Unconscious aggressive instinct.
    - **Subjectivist**: Personal interpretation of insult as offensive.

- These perspectives are **not mutually exclusive**; combining them often gives a more complete picture.

### **1. Biological Perspective**

- Focuses on **neurobiological processes** underlying behavior.
- Example: **Depression** is seen as a result of neurotransmitter imbalances.
- Memory research emphasizes brain structures like the **hippocampus**.
    - **Childhood amnesia** may stem from an underdeveloped hippocampus.
### **2. Behavioral Perspective**

- Focuses on **observable behavior** shaped by **conditioning and reinforcement**.
- Behavior is learned through consequences.
    - Example: A student answers questions correctly to earn stickers (rewards).
- Rooted in **classical and operant conditioning**.

### **3. Cognitive Perspective**

- Emphasizes **mental processes** like perception, memory, reasoning, and decision-making.
- Behavior is understood by analyzing **how information is processed** in the mind.
- Mind is often compared to a **computer**: input, processing, and output.
### **4. Psychoanalytic Perspective**

- Based on **unconscious influences** on behavior.
    
- Key ideas:
    
    - Behavior is driven by **hidden thoughts, fears, and desires**.
    - **Childhood experiences** shape adult personality.
    - Internal **conflicts** can cause emotional problems.
        
- Example: Forgetting a dentist appointment might reflect an **unconscious desire** to avoid it.
### **5. Subjectivist Perspective**

- **Core Idea**: Human behavior is based on **how people perceive and interpret the world**, not on objective reality.
    
### **Key Concepts**

- **Reality is subjective** – each person views the world differently.
- Understanding behavior requires knowing a person’s **“definition of the situation.”**
- Interpretation varies by **culture**, **personal history**, and **motivational state**.
- Emphasizes **personal meaning** over objective facts.
- People are **active creators of meaning**, not passive responders to events.
- Most **open to individual and cultural differences**, emotion, and motivation.
### **Example**

**Same car accident**, different reactions:

- **Person A**: Sees it as a **tragedy**, feels sad.
- **Person B**: Thinks it proves people drive too fast.
- **Person C**: **Panics**, reliving trauma from a similar past experience.
