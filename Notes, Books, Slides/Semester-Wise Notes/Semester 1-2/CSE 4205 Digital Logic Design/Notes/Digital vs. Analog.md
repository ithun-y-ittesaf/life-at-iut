Digital Systems: A digital system is an electronic system that processes, stores, and communicates information using digital data.

Digital - Based on digits/ Discrete Values. 


| Differences       | Digital               | Analog                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Representation    | Discrete              | Continuous w varying magnitude |
| Signal Form       | Square Waves          | Sine Waves                     |
| Response to Noise | Less Affected         | Likely to get affected         |
| Processing        | Simple & Programmable | Complex and less flexible      |
| Storage           | Easy & Accurate       | Hard to store without loss.    |
