<h2>Acronym: D E A L E R</h2>
D E A: Dividends, Expenses, Assets (Debit)
L E R: Liability, Equity, Revenue (Credit)

If D, E, A increases, Debit Increases. If L, E, R increases, Credit increases.

<h2>Asset = Liabilities + Owner's Equity</h2>
Owned Stuff = Owed Stuff
Debit = Credit

*Whenever you measure something, you measure it based on equity*

Example: What does dividend do to equity? It reduces equity. That means, dividend is the opposite of equity. Since equity is *owed stuff* or *credit*, dividend will be debit.
