# **Comprehensive Notes on Psychological Development**

## **1. Introduction to Psychological Development**

- **Definition**: Psychological development refers to changes in an individual's physical, cognitive, emotional, intellectual, and social capabilities from infancy to old age.
- **Developmental Psychology**: Scientific study of how humans grow, change, and adapt across their lifespan.
  - Originally focused on infants/children, now includes adolescence, adulthood, and aging.
- **Key Dimensions**:
  - **Physical Development**: Growth of the body and brain.
  - **Cognitive Development**: Changes in thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving.
  - **Social-Emotional Development**: Changes in relationships, self-concept, and emotions.

### **Central Questions in Developmental Psychology**
1. **Nature vs. Nurture**: How do biological factors interact with environmental experiences?
2. **Continuity vs. Stages**: Is development gradual or a series of distinct stages?
## **2. Heredity and Environment**
### **Nature vs. Nurture Debate**
- **John Locke (Tabula Rasa)**: Believed infants are born as "blank slates," shaped entirely by experience.
- **Charles Darwin (Evolution)**: Emphasized biological inheritance.
- **Behaviorism (Watson & Skinner)**: Argued environment shapes behavior entirely.
  - Watson’s claim: Infants can be molded into any adult role through training.

### **Modern Consensus**
- **Interactionist View**: Both genetics and environment interact continuously.
  - **Example**: Brain development is influenced by genes and early stimulation/deprivation.
### **Maturation and Environmental Influence**
- **Maturation**: Innately determined growth sequences (e.g., fetal development).
  - **Environmental Disruptions**: Maternal sickness, malnutrition, or substance use can alter maturation.
- **Motor Development**: 
  - **Cultural Variations**: 
    - Kipsigis (Kenya): Babies taught to sit/walk early → reach milestones faster.
    - Ache (Paraguay): Limited locomotion practice → walk later but catch up.

### **Critical/Sensitive Periods**
- **Critical Period**: Time when specific experiences are essential for normal development (e.g., fetal sex organ development).
- **Sensitive Period**: Optimal time for development (e.g., first year for attachment, preschool for language).
## **3. Capacities of the Newborn**
### **Vision**
- **Newborns**: Poor acuity, prefer high-contrast edges, curved lines, and complex patterns.
- **Facial Preference**: 
  - Newborns prefer normal faces over scrambled but not distorted ones.
  - By 3 months, prefer normal faces over rabbit-like distortions.

### **Hearing**
- **Preference for Mother’s Voice**: Recognize and prefer it prenatally.
- **Motherese (Baby Talk)**: Higher pitch, longer pauses; infants prefer it and learn word boundaries faster.
- **Discrimination**: Newborns distinguish rhythmically different languages (e.g., Japanese vs. Polish).

### **Taste and Smell**
- **Taste**: Prefer sweet; disgusted by bitter/sour (universal facial expressions).
- **Smell**: Recognize mother’s milk odor; innate preference for breast milk.

### **Learning and Memory**
- **Newborns**: Quickly learn cause-effect (e.g., head-turning for rewards).
- **3-Month-Olds**: Remember actions (e.g., moving a mobile) after 8 days.

## **4. Cognitive Development in Childhood**
### **Piaget’s Stage Theory**
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Schemas**: Mental frameworks for understanding the world.
  - **Assimilation**: Fitting new info into existing schemas.
  - **Accommodation**: Modifying schemas for new info.

#### **Piaget’s Stages**
| **Stage**               | **Age**      | **Key Characteristics**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensorimotor**        | 0–2 years    | Learns through senses/actions; develops object permanence (~1 year).                   |
| **Preoperational**      | 2–7 years    | Uses symbols (e.g., pretend play); egocentric; lacks conservation.                      |
| **Concrete Operational**| 7–11 years   | Logical thinking about concrete objects; masters conservation.                         |
| **Formal Operational**  | 12+ years    | Abstract/hypothetical reasoning; systematic problem-solving.                           |

- **Critiques of Piaget**:
  - Underestimated infants (e.g., object permanence at 4.5 months).
  - Overlooked cultural/task influences.

### **Alternative Theories**
1. **Information-Processing**: Focuses on memory/attention development (continuous, not staged).
2. **Knowledge-Acquisition**: Kids/adults think similarly; differences due to knowledge (e.g., chess experts).
3. **Sociocultural (Vygotsky)**:
   - **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**: Gap between independent and guided performance.
   - **Scaffolding**: Adults provide support to bridge ZPD.

### **Theory of Mind**
- **Definition**: Understanding others have unique thoughts/beliefs.
- **Development**:
  - Age 2: Grasps desires.
  - Age 4: Understands false beliefs (e.g., "candy box" experiment).
- **Autism Link**: Difficulty inferring others’ mental states.

### **Moral Development**
- **Piaget’s Stages**:
  1. **Parallel Play (2–4 yrs)**: No shared rules.
  2. **Moral Absolutism (5–7 yrs)**: Rules are sacred; judges by consequences.
  3. **Social Conventions (7–10 yrs)**: Rules are agreements; considers intent.
  4. **Ideological Reasoning (12+ yrs)**: Flexible, fairness-focused rules.
- **Kohlberg’s Stages**:
  - **Preconventional**: Avoid punishment/seek rewards.
  - **Conventional**: Social approval/law-and-order.
  - **Postconventional**: Ethics over laws (e.g., human rights).
## **5. Personality and Social Development**
### **Temperament**
- **Types (Thomas & Chess)**:
  - **Easy (40%)**: Adaptable, regular routines.
  - **Difficult (10%)**: Fussy, irregular.
  - **Slow-to-Warm-Up (15%)**: Shy, cautious.
- **Stability**: By age 2, predicts later behavior; shaped by genes and parenting ("goodness of fit").

### **Attachment**
- **Ainsworth’s Strange Situation**:
  - **Secure (60%)**: Comforted by parent’s return.
  - **Insecure (Avoidant/Ambivalent/Disorganized)**: Ignores, clings, or acts confused.
- **Formation**: Responsive parenting → secure attachment.

### **Self-Concept and Gender Identity**
- **Self-Concept**:
  - **Mirror Test (18 mos)**: Recognizes self.
  - **Ages 5–7**: Skill-based identity; **Teens**: Social comparisons.
- **Gender Identity Theories**:
  1. **Social Learning**: Rewards/punishments shape behavior.
  2. **Cognitive-Developmental**: Kids actively adopt gender roles (gender constancy ~6–7 yrs).
  3. **Gender Schema**: Society teaches gender "filters" (e.g., pink = girls).

## **6. Adolescent Development**
### **Identity Development (Erikson & Marcia)**
| **Status**               | **Description**                                  | **Example**                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Identity Achievement** | Resolved crisis; clear values.                  | "I’ll be a doctor—I love science."          |
| **Foreclosure**          | Adopts parents’ views without exploration.      | "I’m a lawyer like my dad."                 |
| **Moratorium**           | Actively exploring but undecided.               | "Trying art and activism—still figuring out." |
| **Identity Diffusion**   | No direction or interest.                       | "I’ll just go with the flow."               |

## **Key Comparisons**
### **Piaget vs. Vygotsky**
| **Aspect**       | **Piaget**                          | **Vygotsky**                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Focus**        | Individual exploration.             | Social interaction.               |
| **Stages**       | Universal, invariant.               | Continuous, culturally variable.  |
| **Role of Adults** | Minimal (child discovers).         | Crucial (scaffolding).            |

### **Moral Development: Piaget vs. Kohlberg**
| **Piaget**                     | **Kohlberg**                     |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Focused on children (≤12 yrs). | Extended to adulthood.           |
| 4 stages (rules → fairness).   | 6 stages (punishment → ethics).  |
