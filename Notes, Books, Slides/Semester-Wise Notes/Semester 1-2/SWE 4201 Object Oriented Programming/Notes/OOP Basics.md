Programming: the craft of transforming requirements into something that the computer can execute.

Procedural Programming: Programmers implement requirement by breaking them down to small steps. Programmer creates the recipe that the computer can understand and execute.

## How does OOP Work?
>>Breaks down requirements into objects with properties/ responsibilities, not into functional steps. 
>>Deals better with changes in requirements

## Why OOP?
- Modularize Software Development, just like any other engineering discipline. 
- Make software projects more manageable and predictable. 
- Better maintainability, less maintenance cost
- Re-usable code and prevention of reinvention of the wheel every time.

## Features of OOP
- Emphasis on data rather than on procedure
- Programs are divided into what are known as objects
- Functions that operate on data of an object are tied together in a data structure
- Object may communicate with each other through functions
- New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary

## Object vs. Class

An Object is an instance of a class that is created dynamically. It is allocated a block of memory and configured as per the blueprint provided by the class underlying the object.

Classes are about defining an object. It consists of attributes and behaviors. Simply put, a Class is a blueprint of an object or template for an object.
