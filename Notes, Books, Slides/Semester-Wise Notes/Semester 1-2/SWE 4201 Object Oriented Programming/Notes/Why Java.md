## History
- Developed by Sun Microsystems (James Gosling)
- Originally called *Oak*
- Based on C/C++/C#
- Designed for easy Web/ Internet Applications

## Characteristics of Java
- Object Oriented
- Simple
	- Automatic Memory Management: No dangling Pointers, or memory leaks
	- Simplifies Pointer Handling: No explicit reference/ dereference operations
	- Similar syntax to C
- Cross-Platform
	- Compiles to machine-independent bytecode
	- All major OS have Java runtime environments
	- Compiled for a VM based on bytecodes (Just-in-time compiler translates bytecodes into machine code just before execution)
- Robust
	- A lot more compiler and runtime checks than C++. 
	- Harder to make mistakes
- Portable
	- Standard (fixed) data sizes
	- Libraries: Java includes
- Multi-threaded:
	- Several threads can run in parallel. Direct Standard Language Support for Multitasking
- High Performance:
	- Java runtimes interpret programs slowly BUT the just in time compilation translates the Java bytecodes into native machine code just before a program is run. This makes it nearly as fast as C++
- Java Class Libraries
	- Java contains class libraries known as Java API which contain methods to perform tasks.
