## Scope and Lifetime of Variables

- **Scope**: Refers to the part of the program where a variable is accessible.
- **Lifetime**: Refers to how long a variable exists in memory before it is destroyed.

## Instance Variables

Instance variables are defined within a class but **outside any method or constructor**. Each object (instance) of the class has its **own copy** of these variables.

### Example:

```java
public class Car {
    String color;  // Instance variable
    int speed;     // Instance variable

    public Car(String c, int s) {
        color = c;
        speed = s;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Color: " + color + ", Speed: " + speed);
    }
}
```

Each time you create a `Car` object, it gets its own `color` and `speed`.

## Argument Variables

These are the variables defined in the **parameter list** of a method or constructor. Their **scope** is limited to that method/constructor and are **destroyed once the method completes execution**.

### Example:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {  // 'a' and 'b' are argument variables
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Variables `a` and `b` only exist during the execution of the `add` method.

## Local Variables

Local variables are declared **inside a method or constructor**, excluding the parameter list. Their scope and lifetime are **confined to the block** where they are defined.

### Example:

```java
public class Greeting {
    public void sayHello() {
        String message = "Hello, world!";  // Local variable
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

`message` only exists within the `sayHello()` method.
## Class Variables

Class variables are also known as **static variables**. They are declared using the `static` keyword and belong to the **class itself**, not to any instance. **All objects share the same copy** of the class variable.

### Example:

```java
public class Counter {
    static int count = 0;  // Class variable

    public Counter() {
        count++;
    }

    public static void displayCount() {
        System.out.println("Total objects created: " + count);
    }
}
```

No matter how many `Counter` objects you create, the `count` variable will be shared and updated among them all.
